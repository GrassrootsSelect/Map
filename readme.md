**Map State/ District/Candidate/Resource Project**
_(aka our website)_

**What will it do?**
Allow visitors to search by address, or navigate to their home state and district.

The state page will list all the districts, have a list of candidates, a list of issues/legislation, and links to resources that empower the visitor to support their local progressive candidates (example: link to candidate donate form, volunteer tools, phonebanking tool, etc) or join/organize support for ballot initiatives and pending legislation.

Each district page will filter the lists to only show information specific to the given district.

There will be a candidate page that similarly filters resources candidates, resources, and issues/legislation.

The state, district, and candidate pages will have a signup form to receive an SMS reminder to vote.

District pages will include share links for various dynamically-generated infographics related to that district's race.
